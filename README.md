Toolbox for Analysis of Flexural Isostasy - TAFI is a Matlab based toolbox which takes advantage of Matlab's GUI capabilities to 
create forward models of flexural deflection of elastic lithosphere overlying inviscid substrate. 

To use TAFI, create a new 'TAFI' directory on your computer and download TAFI_v1.0 in that directory. 
From Matlab's workspace, navigate to TAFI_v1.0 folder.
Enter TAFI at command line and start modeling :)

TAFI can be used as a teaching tool or as a research tool.  Detailed paper about TAFI's structure, workflow, functions and instructions are in review at Geosphere. The webpage will be updated as soon as the paper is in press with correct citation. Till then, please cite this Github page, when using TAFI. The code developers would like to know who you are and what you expect from flexure modeling. So, we appreciate, if you drop us a line after downloading the code.
