Toolbox for Analysis of Flexural Isostasy - TAFI is a Matlab based toolbox which takes advantage of Matlab's GUI capabilities to 
create forward models of flexural deflection of elastic lithosphere overlying inviscid substrate. 

To use TAFI, create a new 'TAFI' directory on your computer and download TAFI_v1.0 in that directory. 
From Matlab's workspace, navigate to TAFI_v1.0 folder.
Enter TAFI at command line and start modeling :)

TAFI can be used as a teaching tool or as a research tool. Please cite Github page, when using TAFI.
